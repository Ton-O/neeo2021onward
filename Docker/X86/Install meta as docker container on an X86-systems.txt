INSTALLING META as Docker container image on X86-systems

START FROM SCRATCH:
 
This section describes how to get the meta docker-image on your docker server.
It is assumed that you already have a working docker environment up and running with access to docker commands.

1) Login to the computer that has docker running.
2) Now run docker pull tonot1/neeo-meta:intel to pull the X86-image from hub.docker. Please note that there's also Raspbian-versions of the image, so take care to use the :intel version
3) Then you can run docker: "docker run --name meta --net=host tonot1/neeo-meta:intel".
   The --name just assigns the container the name meta, you can choose whatever you like (and is allowed by Docker)
   The --net=host is here to share your own network with the container; we're checking to see if we can dispose off this, but for now, it's required.


That's it!
You can also build an image yourself, just use the Dockerfile that is in this directory, and copy the scripts directory with it, as that's the start-script for everything
